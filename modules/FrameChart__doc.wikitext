<code>Module:FrameChart</code> is used to generate timelines which represent the given frame data as a set of discrete frames color coded by their classification.

==Usage==
Any page which uses the FrameChart module should include the template [[Template:FrameChartKey]] which explains each of the colored squares generated by the graph. 

Creating a frame chart involves defining a number of values for the code to plot on the timeline. If a given value is left out, it will not be drawn.
* '''startup''' - the quantity of startup frames. By default, this includes the first active frame of the move. As is standard for  Dustloop.
* '''active''' - the quantity of active frames. Can be multiple sections [2-N].
* '''recovery''' - the quantity of recovery frames after all active frames have ended.
* '''inactive''' - The quantity of frames during which the move is not active which occur in between two sets of active frames. Can be multiple sections [2-N].
* '''specialRecovery''' - The quantity of non-standard recovery frames tied to a move. These include things such as Landing Recovery.
* '''offset''' - The quantity of active frames which occur before the inactive frames. This is used for handling edge cases, or as an alternative syntax to inactive.
* '''isProjectile''' - a bar created after startup frames indicating a projectile was spawned.
* '''isStrikeProjectile''' - a bar created after active frames indicating a projectile was spawned. Used when the attack starts with a strike and is followed up by a projectile
* '''frcStart''' - the first frame which an FRC can occur on.
* '''frcEnd''' - the last frame which an FRC can occur on.
* '''cancelStart''' - the first frame a cancel can occur on, an alternative syntax to frcStart. Can be multiple sections [2-N].
* '''cancelEnd''' - the last frame a cancel can occur on, an alternative syntax to frcEnd. Can be multiple sections [2-N].
* '''title''' - a title for a given FrameChart, most useful when making multiple FrameCharts in one area.
*'''startupIsFirstActive''' - the first active frame is the last frame of startup. True by default as that is the standard. Set to false for cases such as when Active frames are skipped.

==Examples==

===Frame Chart Key===
{{FrameChartKey}}

===Simple===

{| class="wikitable"
! Startup !! Active !! Recovery
|-
| 8 || 2 || 10
|}
<pre>
{{#invoke:FrameChart|drawFrameData
|startup         = 8
|active          = 2
|recovery        = 10
}}
</pre>
{{#invoke:FrameChart|drawFrameData
|startup         = 8
|active          = 2
|recovery        = 10
}}

===Inactive Frames===
{| class="wikitable"
! Startup !! Active !! Recovery
|-
| 8 || 2(3)2 || 10
|}
<pre>
{{#invoke:FrameChart|drawFrameData
|startup         = 8
|active          = 2
|inactive2       = 3
|active3         = 2
|recovery        = 10
}}
</pre>
{{#invoke:FrameChart|drawFrameData
|startup         = 8
|active          = 2
|inactive2       = 3
|active3         = 2
|recovery        = 10
}}

===Complex===
The following example uses multiple optional features of the framechart: title, frc window, and special recovery.

{| class="wikitable"
! Startup !! Active !! Recovery
|-
| 8 || 4 || 5+10
|}
<pre>
{{#invoke:FrameChart|drawFrameData
|title           = Complex Example
|startup         = 8
|active          = 4
|recovery        = 5
|specialRecovery = 10
|frcStart        = 9
|frcEnd          = 10
}}
</pre>
{{#invoke:FrameChart|drawFrameData
|title           = Complex Example
|startup         = 8
|active          = 4
|recovery        = 5
|specialRecovery = 10
|frcStart        = 9
|frcEnd          = 10
}}

===Projectile + Cancel Window===
{| class="wikitable"
! Startup !! Active !! Recovery
|-
| 18 || 32 || Total 51 
|}
<pre>
{{#invoke:FrameChart|drawFrameData
|startup              = 18
|isProjectile         = true
|startupIsFirstActive = false
|recovery             = 33
|cancelStart1         = 20
|cancelEnd1           = 21
|cancelStart2         = 25
|cancelEnd2           = 26
}}
</pre>
{{#invoke:FrameChart|drawFrameData
|startup              = 18
|isProjectile         = true
|startupIsFirstActive = false
|recovery             = 33
|cancelStart1         = 20
|cancelEnd1           = 21
|cancelStart2         = 25
|cancelEnd2           = 26
}}
