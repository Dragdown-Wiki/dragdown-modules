The Pikmin Module/Template is for discussing any instance of {{StockIcon|game=PPlus|Olimar}} / {{StockIcon|game=SSBU|Olimar}}, or any situation where specific interactions with Pikmin are relevant. 

'''The only input to this template is the color of the Pikmin desired.'''
<pre>{{Pikmin|Red}}</pre>

Below are the supported Pikmin types:
* {{Pikmin|Red}}
* {{Pikmin|Blue}}
* {{Pikmin|Yellow}}
* {{Pikmin|Purple}}
* {{Pikmin|White}}
* {{Pikmin|Winged}}
* {{Pikmin|Captain}}

The {{Pikmin|Captain}} input is intended to represent situations that depend on the Pikmin captain or situations where the captain has no Pikmin in their queue.
