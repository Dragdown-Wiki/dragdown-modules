* In this matchup, Clairen's range keeps Maypul out, so it's up to Maypul to find a way to make Clairen approach and whiff punish her options.
* Tools like {{special|Lily}} start to become a liability in this matchup, due to the threat of {{special|NFZ}}. 
* Whiff punish her landings, as hard as this sounds.
